Preamble

The packet lineage and evidence chain defines how all information within the Agile Exchange is traced, verified, and reconstructed. Every packet must contain an unbroken lineage to its physical origin, its jurisdictional context, its harmonic identity, and its constitutional purpose. Lineage prevents synthetic packets, unverifiable states, timestamp manipulation, and cross-ledger contamination. It ensures the system can reconstruct its entire truth-state at any point.

Article 1 — Introduction

Conventional digital networks and blockchains allow packets to exist without proof of origin, without physical evidence, without deterministic routing, and without reconstructable history. These weaknesses permit replay attacks, synthetic data, and unverifiable events. The packet lineage and evidence chain solves these problems by enforcing strict parent-child relationships, immutable cryptographic seals, and deterministic evidence trails.

Article 2 — Packet structure

Each lawful packet in the Agile Exchange includes:
- SHA-512 payload hash
- Ed25519 lineage signature
- harmonic identity classification
- jurisdiction metadata
- timestamp pair (UTC and local)
- parent reference chain pointer
- ledger domain mapping
- PD-chain compliance flag

A packet missing any component is invalid.

Article 3 — Parent-child lineage

Every packet must reference its immediate parent unless it is a genesis event. The lineage chain forms a reconstructable truth pathway showing:
- where the packet originated
- what device created it
- which biological identity was involved (if applicable)
- what physical event triggered it
- how it moved through the system
- how it changed over time

Lineage must be complete, readable, and cryptographically verifiable.

Article 4 — Evidence chain

The evidence chain is the complete set of linked packets originating from a physical trigger. It contains:
- physical measurements
- environmental data
- mechanical signatures
- device lineage proofs
- jurisdiction and timestamp validation
- harmonic classification results
- ledger assignments and arbitration records

The evidence chain proves not only what happened, but how, where, when, and under what lawful identity.

Article 5 — PD-chain integration

No packet may enter the system without passing PD-chain verification. This ensures:
- no body without record
- no record without body
- no seal, no state
- one-to-one mapping between physical and digital events

Packets failing equivalence checks are rejected or quarantined.

Article 6 — Arbitration triggers

Lineage breaks automatically trigger arbitration. Breaks include:
- missing parent references
- invalid timestamps
- jurisdiction inconsistencies
- altered payloads
- tampered lineage signatures
- harmonic misalignment

Arbitration resolves disputes, restores lawful state, and isolates anomalies.

Article 7 — Attack prevention

The lineage and evidence chain prevents:
- replay attacks
- synthetic packet insertion
- AI-generated event fabrication
- timestamp manipulation
- jurisdiction laundering
- man-in-the-middle packet rewriting
- cross-ledger contamination
- unsanctioned identity claims

Packets cannot be forged because lineage signatures reveal tampering.

Article 8 — Applications

The packet lineage and evidence chain supports:
- supply-chain authenticity
- ESG environmental proof
- mechanical and industrial telemetry
- water and soil truth systems
- orbital and transport data integrity
- insurance claim verification
- legal-grade audit trails
- disaster recovery and system reconstruction

Because lineage is complete and reconstructable, the entire system behaves as a sovereign truth engine.
