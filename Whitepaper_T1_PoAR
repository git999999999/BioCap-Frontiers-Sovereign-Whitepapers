Preamble
PoAR replaces mining, staking, and trust-based consensus with a sovereignty-first model anchored in physical reality. Validators are selected through measurable activity and harmonic rotation rather than computational power or financial stake.

Article 1 — Introduction
Traditional consensus models rely on economic weight, energy consumption, or probabilistic selection, leading to Sybil attacks, centralization, hardware escalation, and economic manipulation.
PoAR eliminates these vulnerabilities with deterministic sovereign selection.

Article 2 — Proof of Activity (PoA)
Activity must originate from a real physical event:
- torque signature
- harmonic motion pattern
- vibration fingerprint
- biomechanical delta
- environmental deviation
Activity packets include:
- SHA-512 evidence hash
- device lineage signature
- timestamp pair
- harmonic address
- jurisdiction code
Synthetic activity is rejected via harmonic irregularity detection.

Article 3 — Proof of Rotation (PoR)
Rotation determines which validator processes the next period using:
- harmonic class
- recent activity window
- jurisdiction weighting
- identity-tree depth
- cadence alignment
Rotation cannot be influenced or manipulated.

Article 4 — Eligibility Requirements
Nodes must have:
- verified biological identity
- valid device lineage
- harmonic-valid address
- PD-chain activity
- no arbitration flags

Article 5 — Attack Resistance
PoAR prevents:
- replay attacks
- synthetic activity
- AI-simulated motion
- stake dominance
- timestamp forgery
- cross-realm injection

Article 6 — Zero-Energy Sovereignty
PoAR consumes no mining electricity, GPU, or ASIC cycles. Validation derives from physical truth, not computation.

Article 7 — Integration
PoAR is native to MOTION, SYSTEM, arbitration, PD-chain validator, and harmonic scoring engines.

Article 8 — Global Impact
PoAR enables sovereign environmental markets, zero-energy settlements, AI-safe computing, mechanical truth verification, and identity-bound governance.
