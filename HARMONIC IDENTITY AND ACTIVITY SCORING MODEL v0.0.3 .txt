Preamble

The harmonic identity and activity scoring model defines how the Agile Exchange evaluates lawful identity and measures physical activity under 3-6-9 harmonic law. This scoring model ensures that identity is proven, activity is real, and all participation remains anchored in measurable truth. The model prevents synthetic identity, simulated motion, and probabilistic interpretation, enabling a deterministic and constitutionally aligned evaluation of system behavior.

Article 1 — Introduction

Traditional scoring systems rely on statistical estimates, reputation, or economic weight. These approaches allow manipulation, forgery, synthetic participation, and bias. The harmonic scoring model removes these vulnerabilities by grounding identity and activity in physical origin, harmonic structure, and constitutional alignment. Scoring is never subjective; it is a mathematical classification of truth.

Article 2 — Harmonic identity scoring

Identity scoring evaluates:
- biological authenticity
- biometric signatures
- device lineage integrity
- jurisdiction and timestamp pairing
- harmonic identity class (.3, .6, .9)
- PD-chain equivalence proof

Identity cannot be created, approximated, or simulated. Only identities aligned with harmonic law receive valid scoring.

Article 3 — Activity scoring

Activity scoring requires measurable, lawful physical activity such as:
- torque changes
- rotational deltas
- vibration fingerprints
- biomechanical movement
- environmental deviation

Activity must originate from a verified device and be sealed with PD-chain evidence. Synthetic activity receives a score of zero and triggers anomaly detection.

Article 4 — Harmonic coherence

Identity and activity must remain harmonically coherent. Coherence checks ensure:
- cadence alignment
- harmonic periodicity
- lawful timing
- correct identity-action correlation
- proper jurisdictional mapping

Breaks in coherence trigger arbitration and may invalidate scoring.

Article 5 — Scoring thresholds and classification

Scores are assigned according to:
- harmonic class transitions
- time-domain consistency
- magnitude of lawful activity
- lineage completeness
- constitutional relevance

The scoring system produces:
- identity readiness state
- activity authenticity grade
- harmonic alignment index
- arbitration flags when needed

Article 6 — Synthetic detection and prevention

The scoring model identifies and rejects:
- AI-generated identity claims
- synthetic or replayed activity
- timestamp distortions
- jurisdiction laundering
- off-cadence events
- manipulated routing attempts

Detection is automatic and requires no probabilistic inference.

Article 7 — Integration with PoAR and PD-chain

The scoring model directly supports:
- PoAR validator eligibility
- PD-chain physical-digital equivalence checks
- arbitration routing
- ledger domain placement
- device trust boundaries

Identity and activity cannot influence consensus without lawful scoring.

Article 8 — Applications

The harmonic scoring model enables:
- sovereign identity integrity
- fraud-proof mechanical telemetry
- environmental and ESG scoring
- industrial compliance auditing
- transport and fleet sovereignty
- orbital mission authenticity
- regenerative agriculture metrics

Every score reflects truth, never probability.
