Preamble

The multi-realm boundary enforcement model defines how the Agile Exchange maintains absolute truth integrity across physical, digital, biological, mechanical, environmental, jurisdictional, and off-world realms. As the system spans Earth-based, orbital, and potentially interplanetary domains, boundary enforcement ensures that no realm may contaminate another with synthetic data, unverifiable evidence, or probabilistic interpretation. Each realm operates under sovereign truth, yet interaction between realms remains lawful, deterministic, and constitutionally constrained.

Article 1 — Introduction

Modern systems blend realms without proof:
- digital events impersonate physical ones
- simulated data overrides biological reality
- synthetic environmental models influence financial markets
- orbital telemetry is reconstructed on Earth without lineage
- AI-generated data penetrates critical systems
- jurisdiction becomes ambiguous in multi-realm operations

Sovereign realm enforcement ensures that each domain maintains truth purity and that cross-realm interactions obey constitutional structure.

Article 2 — The three sovereign realms

The Agile Exchange operates across three primary realms:

1. Physical realm  
   - biological identity  
   - mechanical activity  
   - environmental and hydrological truth  
   - material lineage  
   - energy generation  

2. Digital realm  
   - ledger operations  
   - arbitration  
   - financial settlement  
   - routing and cadence enforcement  
   - SDK-sealed documentation  

3. Off-world realm  
   - orbital and deep-space telemetry (BioCapSE)  
   - radiation, vacuum, microgravity truth  
   - interplanetary jurisdiction  
   - mission lineage  
   - communication blackout reconciliation  

Each realm maintains sovereignty and cannot rewrite another realm’s truth.

Article 3 — PD-chain boundary enforcement

Cross-realm interactions must undergo:
- SHA-512 hashing
- parent–child lineage linking
- timestamp pairing with domain-correct clocks
- jurisdiction metadata specific to the realm
- harmonic classification validating realm type
- SYSTEM ledger boundary mapping

PD-chain becomes the universal enforcement layer.

Article 4 — Harmonic realm classification

Events must map to lawful harmonic identity:

- .3 biological, regenerative, or origin truth  
- .6 structural, jurisdictional, or systems truth  
- .9 active event truth (motion, energy, environmental activity)

Cross-realm harmonic mismatch triggers arbitration.

Article 5 — Realm contamination prevention

The system prevents:
- physical-to-digital synthetic substitution  
- digital-to-physical reinterpretation  
- off-world data reconstruction without lineage  
- AI-generated cross-realm mappings  
- environmental simulation treated as real truth  
- financial actions based on modelled physical events  
- multi-realm jurisdiction laundering  
- replay or remapping of orbital telemetry into Earth truth  

No realm may overwrite another.

Article 6 — Arbitration across realms

When multi-realm conflicts arise:
- arbitration bundles evidence from each realm  
- realm-specific timestamps and signatures are checked  
- off-world blackout cycles are reconciled  
- PD-chain lineage resolves disputed origin  
- SYSTEM ledger seals the canonical truth-state  

Arbitration must respect each realm’s immutable constitutional boundaries.

Article 7 — Multi-realm routing law

All cross-realm packets must:
- follow constitutional routing  
- maintain realm-to-realm separation  
- record ingress/egress at SYSTEM ledger boundaries  
- remain jurisdiction-accurate  
- preserve harmonic cadence cycles  

Routing ensures lawful interoperability without truth blending.

Article 8 — Applications

The multi-realm model enables:
- unified Earth–orbit truth systems (BioCapSE)  
- cross-realm environmental and mechanical verification  
- sovereign financial markets that include off-world activity  
- interplanetary mission governance  
- disaster-mode operation during realm isolation  
- military, aerospace, and scientific realm integrity  
- universal sovereignty across physical, digital, and off-world truth layers  

The sovereign system becomes realm-complete and realm-protected.
