Preamble

Inter-chain compatibility defines how the Agile Exchange may interact with external blockchains, databases, financial networks, or AI systems without violating constitutional boundaries or allowing synthetic contamination. Sovereign boundary enforcement ensures that truth inside the system remains pure, deterministic, and physically anchored—even when interfacing with external systems that lack PD-chain, harmonic law, or identity lineage. Compatibility does not mean trust; it means lawful, controlled, and evidence-bound interaction.

Article 1 — Introduction

External systems (blockchains, ledgers, enterprise databases, IoT networks, cloud services) often rely on:
- unverifiable identities
- synthetic transactions
- probabilistic finality
- mutable logs
- synthetic or AI-generated activity
- missing jurisdiction metadata
- no PD-chain equivalence

Direct interoperability would contaminate sovereign truth. Boundary enforcement ensures safe, lawful interaction.

Article 2 — Sovereign boundary law

All external interaction must satisfy:
- constitutional ledger separation
- strict ingress/egress routing rules
- PD-chain sealing of inbound data
- harmonic classification of event type
- identity validation for external actors
- quarantine of ambiguous or unverifiable data

Nothing external may override or reinterpret sovereign truth.

Article 3 — External-to-sovereign ingress

When external data enters:
- it must undergo PD-chain conversion
- timestamps must be validated
- jurisdiction and legal context must be confirmed
- identity must be harmonically mapped
- synthetic activity must be rejected
- SYSTEM ledger records ingress events

Unverifiable data cannot enter any sovereign ledger.

Article 4 — Sovereign-to-external egress

Outbound data must:
- preserve lineage
- include jurisdiction metadata
- maintain harmonic identity
- avoid exporting confidential ledger elements
- prohibit cross-ledger contamination
- adhere to SDK and sovereign sealing rules

The system never exports internal truth that compromises sovereignty.

Article 5 — External blockchain compatibility

When interacting with blockchains such as:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Solana
- Polkadot
- Enterprise chains

Compatibility requires:
- external transaction lineage verification
- rejection of synthetic or anonymized flows
- lawful mapping of UTXOs or account states
- arbitration for unresolved conflicts
- prohibiting direct ledger merging

External chains remain external; sovereignty is not diluted.

Article 6 — AI and external system boundary

AI systems cannot:
- inject unverified data
- propose ledger changes
- act without PD-chain lineage
- manipulate arbitration
- rewrite system truth

AI operates outside sovereign truth unless governed by constitutional rules.

Article 7 — Attack and contamination prevention

Boundary enforcement prevents:
- synthetic data injection
- jurisdiction laundering
- replay attacks
- probabilistic truth contagion
- trust-based API contamination
- model-generated environmental or financial data
- rogue interoperability attempts

All ingress points become truth firewalls.

Article 8 — Applications

Inter-chain compatibility enables:
- verified BTC settlement (BTC whitepaper)
- enterprise integration without data corruption
- ESG market linkage to external financial systems
- supply-chain truth export for regulators
- off-world mission data synchronization (BioCapSE)
- global interoperability with truth guarantees

External systems may connect, but they may not contaminate.
