Preamble

User rights within the Agile Exchange are grounded in truth, identity, lawful sovereignty, and constitutional protection. Unlike digital platforms that treat users as data sources, analytics targets, or permissionless entities, the sovereign model guarantees that every participant is recognized as a biological identity with non-transferable rights. Sovereign safety ensures that no ledger, device, worker, agent, intelligence, or external party may violate these rights or compromise user protection.

Article 1 — Introduction

Digital systems today offer weak user rights governed by opaque policies, revocable permissions, synthetic identity, and platform-level authority. These architectures allow:
- unauthorized data extraction
- synthetic identity misuse
- surveillance and AI profiling
- forced arbitration without evidence
- loss of access without lawful cause

The sovereign model replaces platform privilege with constitutional user protection.

Article 2 — Right to truth

Every user has the right to:
- truthful system behavior
- truthful identity recognition
- truthful ledger participation
- truthful arbitration outcomes

No synthetic or fabricated system state may override a user's lawful truth.

Article 3 — Right to sovereign identity

Identity rights include:
- biological identity recognition
- non-exportable identity keys
- protection from impersonation
- protection from synthetic identity creation
- device-bound authentication through BioCapES
- harmonically valid identity classification

Identity cannot be altered, substituted, fabricated, or decontextualized.

Article 4 — Right to privacy through constitutional separation

User privacy is guaranteed through:
- multi-ledger separation
- constitutional routing rules
- PD-chain isolation of evidence
- jurisdiction-limited metadata
- prohibition of synthetic aggregation

No entity may aggregate user data across domains without lawful purpose.

Article 5 — Right to safety from AI and synthetic agents

Users are protected from:
- AI-driven behavioral profiling
- synthetic decision-making that affects rights
- automated arbitration rulings without human truth
- system manipulation through AI-generated evidence
- synthetic identity crossover

AI cannot override, reinterpret, or diminish user rights.

Article 6 — Right to lawful access

A user maintains the right to:
- access constitutional documents
- review their PD-chain evidence
- audit their ledger entries
- detect and dispute anomalies
- access the arbitration engine when needed

Access may not be revoked except through lawful arbitration.

Article 7 — Right to dispute resolution

Users are entitled to:
- deterministic arbitration outcomes
- evidence-based ruling
- review of lineage and PD-chain
- constitutional clarity
- protection from synthetic claims
- truth restoration when anomalies occur

Users cannot be penalized without evidence.

Article 8 — Applications

User rights and sovereign safety apply to:
- environmental and ESG reporting
- financial participation and credit formation
- transport and fleet sovereignty
- industrial and mechanical systems
- identity verification and access control
- off-world mission communication (BioCapSE)
- agricultural, water, and biological truth systems

User rights are not permissions granted by a platform—they are constitutional truths.
