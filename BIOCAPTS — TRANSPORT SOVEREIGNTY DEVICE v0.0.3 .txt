Preamble

BioCapTS is the sovereign transport telemetry and compliance device that ensures all vehicle, fleet, and mobility systems operate under physical truth rather than synthetic reporting or unverifiable digital records. It anchors transport events to PD-chain, harmonic law, and device lineage, preventing falsified logs, manipulated emissions data, fraudulent route claims, synthetic GPS paths, or AI-generated telemetry. Transport sovereignty requires that every movement be proven.

Article 1 — Introduction

Transport systems worldwide depend on digital logs that are vulnerable to tampering, spoofing, replay attacks, and synthetic data injection. Whether for logistics, rideshare, public transport, or fleet management, the absence of physical-digital equivalence undermines safety, compliance, and accountability. BioCapTS enforces sovereign truth by binding every transport event to measurable physical evidence.

Article 2 — Hardware requirements

BioCapTS must contain:
- sealed, non-exportable private keys
- device lineage and sovereign identity binding
- GPS and inertial measurement components
- vibration and motion sensors
- dual timestamp generators (UTC and local)
- harmonic signature generator
- PD-chain conversion engine
- jurisdiction encoding memory

These components work together to ensure truthful transport telemetry.

Article 3 — Transport truth domains

BioCapTS captures:
- vehicle location and path authenticity
- acceleration and deceleration events
- vibration and mechanical movement patterns
- route deviations and environmental interactions
- emissions-related physical changes
- loading and unloading events
- motion signatures linked to vehicle type and environment

Every event must originate from physical reality.

Article 4 — PD-chain equivalence

Transport events must pass PD-chain verification:
- on-device hashing
- lineage sealing
- timestamp pairing
- harmonic classification
- jurisdiction correctness
- parent-child reference formation

Synthetic movement fails PD-chain because it lacks physical origin.

Article 5 — Sovereign routing and fleet correctness

BioCapTS ensures:
- routes match physical paths
- distance traveled reflects lawful movement
- GPS spoofing is detected through vibration correlation
- odometer manipulation is blocked by harmonic signatures
- emissions reports reflect physical engine states
- transport fraud becomes impossible

Truth is reconstructed from multiple sensor domains.

Article 6 — Arbitration and anomaly detection

BioCapTS automatically:
- issues ARB-NOTICE packets when anomalies occur
- isolates suspicious segments of travel
- prevents contaminated data from entering ledgers
- flags timing deviations or rotation inconsistencies

Arbitration ensures lawful resolution of disputes.

Article 7 — Deployment environments

BioCapTS is suited for:
- commercial transport fleets
- aviation ground systems
- maritime and inland shipping
- rideshare and taxi operations
- public transit vehicles
- emergency and military vehicles
- autonomous transport systems
- orbital shuttle and re-entry craft

The device operates under diverse and extreme conditions.

Article 8 — Applications

BioCapTS enables:
- sovereign fleet accountability
- regulatory compliance for emissions and safety
- insurance-grade route and incident verification
- fraud-proof supply-chain movement
- ESG-linked transport markets
- off-world navigation and trajectory truth
- zero-trust autonomous driving frameworks

Transport events become sovereign truth, not digital fiction.
