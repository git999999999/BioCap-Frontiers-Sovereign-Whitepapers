Preamble

Municipal recycling systems suffer from unverifiable claims, inflated recycling rates, waste diversion fraud, contamination misreporting, illegal dumping, and synthetic circular economy metrics. The sovereign PLASTIC & MUNICIPAL RECYCLING framework ensures that every material entering a municipal recycling stream maintains immutable physical truth from collection to processing to final output. Circularity becomes provable, not declared.

Article 1 — Introduction

Traditional recycling systems rely on:
- manually entered logs
- unverifiable facility reports
- estimated contamination levels
- synthetic improvements to recycling statistics
- opaque waste management processes
- AI-generated optimization data without physical verification

The sovereign model provides a deterministic, evidence-based recycling system.

Article 2 — Material truth and identity

Each recyclable material batch receives:
- PD-chain lineage identity
- timestamp pairing
- jurisdiction metadata
- contamination-level truth
- harmonic classification (.3 biological, .6 structural, .9 activity)

Material identity may not be substituted or fabricated.

Article 3 — PD-chain conversion for municipal recycling

Every recycling event must pass:
- SHA-512 hashing
- lineage sealing
- timestamp validation
- parent–child reference linking
- jurisdiction correctness
- harmonic mapping

Synthetic recycling entries cannot be accepted.

Article 4 — Collection-to-processing truth chain

Municipal systems must record:
- curbside or depot collection truth
- weight and material-type measurements
- contamination signatures
- transportation and routing events
- sorting facility physical processing
- bale creation and downstream transfer
- recycling or disposal outcomes

Each step must correspond to physical measurement.

Article 5 — Anti-fraud protections

The system prevents:
- inflated recycling rates
- false contamination claims
- illegal landfill diversion
- waste export fraud
- facility manipulation of throughput numbers
- substitution with non-recyclable materials
- synthetic data injection into recycling streams

Recycling becomes an auditable truth-path.

Article 6 — Circular economy verification

Circularity can be claimed only when:
- material is physically collected
- contamination thresholds are met
- sorting and processing events are verified
- the material becomes an output product
- PD-chain lineage remains unbroken

Modelled circularity or unverified outputs are prohibited.

Article 7 — Cross-ledger integration

This system integrates with:
- PLASTIC for material truth
- ESG for sustainability metrics
- WATER for contamination and environmental impact
- BIO for soil and biological interactions
- ENERGY for renewable-powered processing events
- TX for financial settlement of recycling credits

Cross-domain mapping requires harmonic and constitutional validation.

Article 8 — Applications

Municipal recycling sovereignty supports:
- national recycling reporting accuracy
- ESG-compliant corporate waste programs
- insurance-grade waste verification
- anti-dumping and anti-fraud enforcement
- circular economy incentive systems
- municipal budgeting and planning
- off-world material recovery and recycling (BioCapSE)

Recycling becomes a measurable truth system, not a symbolic environmental gesture.
