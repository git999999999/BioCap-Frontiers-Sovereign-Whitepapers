Preamble

Sovereign identity is the anchor of lawful participation in the Agile Exchange. It cannot be fabricated, substituted, simulated, or probabilistically inferred. Identity must originate from biological truth and extend through biometric markers, device lineage, and harmonic classification. BioCapES provides the constitutionally aligned hardware and authentication pathways required to bind biological identity to digital operation under 3-6-9 harmonic law.

Article 1 — Introduction

Most modern identity systems rely on documents, accounts, passwords, or statistical confidence scores. These mechanisms are easily forged, stolen, or artificially reproduced, and they possess no inherent link to biological truth. The sovereign identity model corrects these flaws by grounding identity in DNA-backed biological origin, device lineage, and harmonic alignment. Identity is not a credential; it is a state of being that must exist before system recognition.

Article 2 — Biological identity

Biological identity originates from DNA and cannot be created or replaced by any ledger, device, or intelligence. Biological identity establishes the immutable basis of a sovereign participant. No system component may reinterpret or override biological truth. DNA origin is never transmitted; instead, it is used to establish non-exportable cryptographic keys sealed within BioCapES hardware.

Article 3 — Biometric authentication

Biometric signatures reinforce biological identity through:
- retina verification
- fingerprint patterns
- facial signatures
- lawful biological markers

These markers must align with the user’s DNA-bound identity. Synthetic biometrics or AI-generated images are rejected automatically through harmonic misalignment and lineage inconsistency.

Article 4 — Device lineage

Every BioCapES device carries:
- sealed private keys bound to biological identity
- non-exportable memory
- on-device hashing
- harmonic signature generation
- jurisdiction encoding
- timestamp pairing

Device lineage ensures that identity cannot be transferred, copied, or simulated. A device without lineage cannot participate.

Article 5 — Harmonic identity class

Identity is classified under the 3-6-9 harmonic law:
- .3 = being
- .6 = structure
- .9 = doing

A complete identity requires coherence across all three layers. Harmonic misalignment renders identity invalid until arbitration resolves the anomaly.

Article 6 — PD-chain integration

Identity must be verified through PD-chain. Each action submitted by a BioCapES device must include:
- SHA-512 payload hash
- lineage signature
- harmonic identity classification
- timestamp pair
- jurisdiction metadata

Identity that cannot demonstrate physical-digital equivalence is rejected.

Article 7 — Identity protection and misuse prevention

Sovereign identity rules prevent:
- impersonation
- synthetic identity creation
- AI-generated likeness injection
- replay of biometric signals
- device spoofing
- cross-device identity migration

Any deviation triggers immediate SYSTEM quarantine.

Article 8 — Global application

Sovereign identity enables:
- fraud-proof digital participation
- lawful access to ledgers and services
- secure orbital communication (BioCapSE)
- mechanical and industrial authentication (BioCapMC)
- transport sovereignty (BioCapTS)
- sovereign voting and economic systems
- identity-secured ESG reporting
- off-world identity integrity

Identity is not a convenience layer; it is the foundation of all sovereign truth.
