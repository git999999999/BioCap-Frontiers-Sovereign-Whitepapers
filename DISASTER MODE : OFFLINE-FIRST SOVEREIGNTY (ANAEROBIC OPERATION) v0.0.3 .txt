Preamble

Disaster mode ensures that the Agile Exchange continues operating lawfully when networks fail, power grids collapse, communications degrade, or external systems become unreliable. Offline-first sovereignty guarantees that identity, PD-chain verification, harmonic classification, packet logging, arbitration triggers, and device lineage remain intact without internet or external infrastructure. The system must survive in isolation, operate anaerobically, and later reintegrate without losing truth or allowing synthetic contamination.

Article 1 — Introduction

Most digital systems fail when connectivity fails. They rely on centralized servers, cloud infrastructure, or uninterrupted communication. These dependencies make them vulnerable during disasters, conflicts, or environmental events. Disaster mode ensures that sovereignty does not break when the environment does. Every sovereign device must function autonomously and truthfully under the harshest conditions.

Article 2 — Offline-first identity

A device operating offline must still:
- verify biological identity
- authenticate biometric signatures
- validate device lineage
- enforce harmonic identity classification
- reject synthetic attempts without external reference

Identity cannot depend on network availability.

Article 3 — PD-chain without connectivity

PD-chain must continue to function locally. Offline devices:
- collect physical evidence
- hash and lineage-seal packets
- maintain parent-child chains
- timestamp events with dual clocks
- apply jurisdiction rules (local or cached)
- store evidence until reconnection

Packets cannot be fabricated or overwritten during offline operation.

Article 4 — Local ledger buffering

While offline, devices:
- maintain local append-only logs
- enforce constitutional boundaries
- preserve harmonic cadence cycles
- reject off-domain packets
- quarantine anomalies
- prepare reconciliation bundles

Local logs become canonical once validated after reconnection.

Article 5 — Arbitration in isolation

If anomalies occur offline:
- arbitration flags must be assigned immediately
- ARB-NOTICE packets must be created
- the device must isolate affected packets
- no synthetic reconciliation is allowed

Arbitration decisions may be deferred but not bypassed.

Article 6 — Reintegration protocol

When connectivity is restored:
- buffered logs are sent through PD-chain verification
- harmonic cadence is recalculated
- timestamp drift is resolved
- jurisdiction alignment is restored
- arbitration outcomes are applied
- ledger placement occurs deterministically

No data may be rewritten to “fit” online state; truth must be reconciled exactly as recorded.

Article 7 — Attack resistance in disaster conditions

Offline-first sovereignty prevents:
- forged identity attempts
- fabricated offline histories
- post-event synthetic packet injection
- timestamp manipulation during outages
- data loss or alteration
- rogue devices impersonating legitimate nodes

Packets remain sealed and lineage-bound even without network support.

Article 8 — Applications

Disaster mode enables:
- emergency ESG environmental reporting
- continuity of industrial and safety telemetry
- sovereign operation during war, storms, or outages
- off-grid agricultural and water systems
- transport sovereignty during communication failures
- orbital devices operating outside communication windows
- remote scientific, military, and humanitarian missions

The Agile Exchange remains sovereign even when the world is not.
