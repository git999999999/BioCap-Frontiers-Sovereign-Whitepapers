Preamble
The Energy & Utilities truth system ensures that renewable generation, grid interactions, consumption, and jurisdictional compliance are recorded as physical-digital truth. Traditional energy reporting depends on estimates, synthetic modelling, unverifiable meter logs, or jurisdictional self-reporting. The sovereign framework replaces these with PD-chain evidence, harmonic classification, device-lineage validation, and physical equivalence rules. Renewable energy must be proven, lawful, and anchored to reality.

Article 1 — Introduction
Energy systems are vulnerable to fraud, synthetic signals, inaccurate reporting, and unverifiable generation claims. Renewable credits, emissions reductions, grid feed-ins, and regional compliance often rely on trust-based reporting without physical proof. Sovereign energy monitoring eliminates vulnerability by binding all energy events to lawful physical measurements.

Article 2 — Renewable equivalence
BioCap devices and grid-integrated telemetry must record:
- generation signatures from solar, wind, hydro, thermal, or mechanical sources
- grid feed-in events with harmonic and rotational identity
- meter rotation signals and torque/voltage truth
- consumption events linked to real load states
- renewable equivalence claims based on measurable deltas

Synthetic or estimated renewables cannot enter REC or ESG ledgers.

Article 3 — PD-chain for energy events
Every energy event must undergo:
- SHA-512 hashing
- timestamp pairing (UTC and jurisdictional)
- harmonic classification (.3 biological, .6 structural grid, .9 active generation)
- jurisdiction correctness
- lineage sealing
- parent-child packet mapping

Events failing PD-chain must be quarantined.

Article 4 — Jurisdictional compliance
Energy events must satisfy:
- jurisdictional grid laws
- renewable classification requirements
- cross-border transmission recording
- lawful ownership of generation assets
- truth-based emissions reporting

Jurisdiction metadata becomes immutable evidence.

Article 5 — Fraud resistance
The system prevents:
- synthetic consumption reports
- falsified renewable generation claims
- falsified emissions reductions
- replayed or duplicated meter logs
- AI-generated energy curves
- hacked smart-meter datasets
- off-jurisdiction laundering of energy credits

Only physical load, generation, and grid behavior produce valid packets.

Article 6 — Arbitration
Arbitration resolves:
- mismatched meter signatures
- timestamp drift
- inconsistent grid feed-in claims
- renewable credit disputes
- cross-jurisdiction export inaccuracies
- synthetic or unverifiable data patterns

Arbitration outcomes are deterministic and PD-chain bound.

Article 7 — Applications
Sovereign energy truth enables:
- verified renewable credit markets
- lawful carbon trading
- resilient grid compliance
- national and regional emissions reporting
- industrial energy auditing
- off-grid and off-world renewable mapping (BioCapSE)
- insurance-grade verification of energy events

Energy becomes a truth domain governed by constitutional law.
