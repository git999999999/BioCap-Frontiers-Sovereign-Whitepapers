Preamble

The sovereign network geometry defines how devices, ledgers, packets, and identities are placed within the Agile Exchange using the 3·6·9 harmonic address plane. This structure prevents synthetic nodes, unauthorized access, non-harmonic routing, and network attacks by enforcing deterministic placement based on harmonic identity and constitutional law. The harmonic address plane is not a conventional network topology; it is a truth-based geometric framework that reflects identity, purpose, and lawful operation.

Article 1 — Introduction

Traditional networks allow arbitrary addressing, dynamic assignment, and unverified participation. These systems can be spoofed, flooded, penetrated, or confused by synthetic actors. The sovereign harmonic address plane corrects these flaws by enforcing deterministic, evidence-backed placement of all nodes. No node may exist unless its identity, lineage, jurisdiction, and harmonic class are proven.

Article 2 — Harmonic address classes

The address plane is divided into the three fundamental harmonic classes:
- .3 representing being
- .6 representing structure
- .9 representing doing

Each device or node must be placed in the class corresponding to its operational purpose and identity layer. No device may choose its class; harmonic placement is derived from truth.

Article 3 — Deterministic placement

Nodes are placed into the network using:
- harmonic identity class
- device lineage
- biological identity (when applicable)
- jurisdiction metadata
- PD-chain validation
- timestamp pairing

Placement is deterministic. Identical truth inputs always produce identical network geometry. No dynamic assignment or negotiation occurs.

Article 4 — Address integrity

A lawful sovereign address must:
- terminate in harmonic form (.3, .6, .9)
- reflect the correct identity class
- be bound to device lineage
- include jurisdiction alignment
- pass PD-chain verification

Non-harmonic addresses are rejected automatically.

Article 5 — Routing constraints

Routing must comply with:
- harmonic class transitions
- constitutional ledger boundaries
- PD-chain lineage validation
- jurisdiction mapping
- cadence cycles

Packets cannot traverse the network arbitrarily. Routing is truth-bound, not probabilistic. Synthetic nodes cannot route packets because they fail harmonic verification.

Article 6 — Anti-synthetic protection

The harmonic address plane prevents:
- fake devices
- AI-simulated nodes
- man-in-the-middle insertion
- dynamic rogue addressing
- cross-jurisdiction masquerading
- synthetic topology manipulation

Non-harmonic entities cannot occupy space in the network.

Article 7 — Multi-realm coherence

The harmonic address plane integrates:
- physical realm (device presence and origin)
- digital realm (ledger logic and routing)
- harmonic realm (identity classification and cadence)

Realm integrity ensures no contamination between layers and provides a unified structure for system-wide coherence.

Article 8 — Applications

The 3·6·9 address plane enables:
- lawful device networks
- orbital and terrestrial sovereign communication
- fleet sovereignty and transport integrity
- industrial telemetry safety
- environmental and ESG sensor verification
- off-world relay systems
- AI boundary enforcement

Network geometry is the backbone that ensures only truth-aligned devices exist within sovereign space.
