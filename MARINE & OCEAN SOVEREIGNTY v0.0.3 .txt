Preamble

Marine and ocean sovereignty establishes lawful truth for maritime navigation, vessel integrity, emissions, waste management, hydrological interaction, and environmental impact. Traditional maritime systems rely on AIS transmissions, manual logs, unverifiable cargo declarations, synthetic emissions reporting, and model-driven ocean impact estimates. The sovereign MARINE framework replaces these unreliable methods with PD-chain, harmonic classification, and verifiable physical evidence. Oceans become a truth domain, not an interpretive frontier.

Article 1 — Introduction

The maritime sector suffers from:
- falsified route logs and AIS spoofing
- illegal dumping and untracked waste
- synthetic emissions reporting
- unverifiable ballast-water declarations
- AI-generated maritime telemetry
- untraceable fishing and extraction operations
- jurisdictional evasion through flag manipulation

Marine sovereignty resolves these failures by linking all vessel activity to immutable physical truth.

Article 2 — Maritime truth domains

The MARINE ledger records:
- vessel movement and route integrity
- emissions and engine signatures
- vibration, torque, and hydrodynamic motion
- ballast discharge and water-quality interactions
- cargo lineage and lawful handling
- environmental impact on coastal and deep-water ecosystems
- waste, leakage, or dumping events
- fishing, extraction, and harvesting activity

Every entry must originate from physical measurement, not self-reporting.

Article 3 — PD-chain verification for vessels

All maritime data must undergo PD-chain conversion:
- lineage-sealed device signatures
- SHA-512 hashing at point of capture
- jurisdiction and EEZ metadata
- dual timestamp pairing
- harmonic classification (.3, .6, .9)
- parent–child chain relationships

No synthetic or reprocessed maritime data may enter the ledger.

Article 4 — Corridor and ocean-lane truth

Marine sovereignty requires:
- confirmed physical travel paths
- vibration and hydrodynamic signatures consistent with vessel motion
- integrity checks on AIS and GNSS signals
- detection of spoofed or replayed paths
- legally verified EEZ transitions
- harmonic cadence aligned with true oceanic movement

Oceans cannot be falsified through digital logs.

Article 5 — Emissions and discharge truth

Vessels must submit:
- physically measured emissions data
- fuel burn signatures
- engine load and temperature curves
- hydrological impact from ballast release
- chemical and particulate discharge evidence

Synthetic emissions models and unverifiable inputs are rejected.

Article 6 — Anti-dumping and waste-lineage enforcement

The MARINE system prevents:
- illegal offshore dumping
- fabricated waste manifests
- falsified cargo disposal paths
- jurisdictional manipulation of marine pollution
- AI-generated waste telemetry

All waste events must be lineage-bound, physically measured, and harmonically validated.

Article 7 — Fishing, extraction, and harvesting integrity

Sovereign truth ensures:
- catch volumes match physical movement and biological truth
- extraction events align with ecological and jurisdictional rules
- lineage for harvested materials is complete
- synthetic or inflated catch reporting is impossible

BIO and ESG ledgers integrate for ecological verification.

Article 8 — Applications

Marine sovereignty enables:
- global trade verification and route truth
- insured maritime operations and claims resolution
- coastal protection and environmental compliance
- sovereign fishing and resource governance
- pollution accountability across jurisdictions
- anti-piracy and anti-fraud maritime security
- off-world ocean analogue experiments through BioCapSE

The ocean becomes a domain where truth—not logs, claims, or models—governs.
