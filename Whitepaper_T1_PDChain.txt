Preamble
PD-Chain establishes strict equivalence between physical truth and digital record. No digital entry may exist without physical evidence, and no physical event may enter without lawful digital conversion.

Article 1 — Introduction
Traditional systems permit falsified inputs, unverifiable sensors, synthetic transactions, and unbounded simulation. PD-Chain eliminates these vulnerabilities.

Article 2 — Core Components
Section 2.1 — Physical Anchor
Submissions must originate from hardware devices with lineage-sealed keys, on-device hashing, non-exportable memory, and harmonic signature generation.

Section 2.2 — Digital State
Digital entries must be hashed, timestamp-paired, jurisdiction-locked, and deterministic in ledger routing.

Section 2.3 — Equivalence Seal
Composite includes:
- SHA-512 payload hash
- Ed25519 device signature
- harmonic address
- dual timestamps
- jurisdiction metadata
- parent reference

Section 2.4 — Chain of Custody
Data movement preserves parent references for forensic replay.

Article 3 — PD-Chain Law
1. No record without body
2. No body without record
3. No seal, no state
4. One-to-one lineage
5. Arbitration supremacy

Article 4 — Routing Integration
PD-Chain determines ledger selection, correlation pointers, activity windows, arbitration triggers, and compliance filters.

Article 5 — Attack Prevention
Prevents synthetic data injection, AI-generated evidence, replay attacks, timestamp fraud, cross-ledger contamination, and jurisdiction manipulation.

Article 6 — Industry Applications
Supports ESG settlement, agriculture proofing, water contamination tracing, supply-chain lineage, insurance evidence, logistics routing, and carbon market integrity.
