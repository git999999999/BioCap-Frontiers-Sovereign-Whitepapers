Preamble

The arbitration engine is the constitutional mechanism that resolves conflicts, inconsistencies, lineage breaks, timestamp anomalies, jurisdiction errors, and harmonic misalignments across all ledgers of the Agile Exchange. Unlike traditional legal or computational dispute systems, arbitration within the sovereign framework is deterministic, evidence-bound, and entirely dependent on physical-digital truth. No subjective interpretation, synthetic evidence, or probabilistic reasoning is permitted.

Article 1 — Introduction

Disputes arise when evidence conflicts or deviations occur between:
- PD-chain lineage
- harmonic classification
- jurisdiction metadata
- ledger boundaries
- timestamp pairing
- device or identity integrity

Traditional systems often rely on opinion, negotiation, or statistical interpretation to resolve such discrepancies. The sovereign arbitration engine uses only truth, derived from physical-digital equivalence and constitutional law.

Article 2 — Arbitration triggers

Arbitration is triggered automatically when:
- lineage breaks occur
- timestamps drift or conflict
- packets violate harmonic cadence
- PD-chain evidence is incomplete or tampered
- jurisdiction claims mismatch reality
- synthetic or replayed data is detected
- cross-ledger contamination is attempted
- identity cannot be proven

Triggers generate ARB-NOTICE packets.

Article 3 — Evidence bundle formation

The arbitration engine compiles an evidence bundle containing:
- parent–child lineage references
- PD-chain equivalence seals
- harmonic structure logs
- timestamp pairs (UTC and local)
- jurisdiction metadata
- device lineage information
- affected ledger entries
- anomaly markers from sovereign devices

This bundle forms the immutable foundation of arbitration.

Article 4 — Deterministic resolution

Arbitration outcomes must follow constitutional truth:
- synthetic packets are rejected
- missing lineage invalidates affected entries
- wrong-jurisdiction packets are quarantined
- off-cadence packets are neutralized
- identity inconsistencies deactivate participation until resolved
- cross-ledger violations are rolled back

Outcomes cannot be influenced by stake, computation, negotiation, or AI.

Article 5 — Ledger reconciliation

Upon resolution:
- lawful packets are accepted
- rejected packets are permanently sealed as invalid
- ledger integrity is restored
- arbitration state is logged in the SYSTEM ledger
- parent/child relationships are revalidated
- cadence alignment is recalculated

The reconciliation process ensures the system remains an accurate reflection of truth.

Article 6 — Device and identity action

When arbitration affects devices or identities:
- misaligned devices may be temporarily quarantined
- identity conflicts require revalidation through BioCapES
- repeated anomalies may result in long-term suspension
- all anomalies are logged for sovereign review

Device and identity integrity are essential for long-term trust.

Article 7 — Attack and anomaly detection

Arbitration protects the system from:
- AI-generated evidence fabrication
- timestamp manipulation
- identity spoofing
- synthetic motion or environmental data
- cross-ledger tampering
- jurisdiction laundering
- replay attacks
- collusion attempts

Every attempted bypass ultimately fails due to lineage and harmonic verification.

Article 8 — Applications

The arbitration engine enforces:
- cross-domain environmental truth
- sovereign financial accuracy
- mechanical authenticity
- identity integrity
- disaster-mode reconciliation
- compliance and regulatory correctness
- orbital truth integration (BioCapSE)
- deterministic multi-ledger system operation

Arbitration is the sovereign safeguard of truth.
