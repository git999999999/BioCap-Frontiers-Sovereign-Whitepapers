Preamble

The multi-vertical equivalence model establishes how environmental, biological, renewable, hydrological, and material truth domains correlate within the Agile Exchange. Each vertical—ESG, REC, BIO, WATER, and PLASTIC—represents a lawful truth system with its own ledger, boundaries, and evidence requirements. This model defines the rules by which data may be related across these domains without contamination, reinterpretation, or synthetic equivalence. It ensures that cross-vertical relationships remain grounded in measurable truth and lawful constitutional structure.

Article 1 — Introduction

Environmental and industrial systems are interconnected, but conventional data platforms treat these sectors as isolated silos or aggregate them through unverifiable statistical models. Such approaches produce synthetic equivalence, distortion, and fraud. The multi-vertical equivalence model maintains strict domain boundaries while enabling lawful cross-domain correlation through PD-chain evidence and harmonic mapping.

Article 2 — Vertical independence

Each vertical is sovereign and cannot be altered or contaminated by another. Their domains are:
- ESG: environmental outputs and integrity
- REC: renewable energy generation and dispatch
- BIO: soil health, biological regeneration, biomass deltas
- WATER: hydrological integrity, contamination, movement
- PLASTIC: circularity, waste lineage, microplastic paths

Each vertical has a dedicated ledger and explicit truth-domain.

Article 3 — Lawful equivalence

Equivalence between verticals may occur only when:
- physical evidence originates from PD-chain-verified sources
- lineage is complete and auditable
- jurisdiction metadata is consistent
- timestamps align harmonically
- the relationship is explicitly allowed by constitutional mapping

Equivalence is never assumed; it must be proven.

Article 4 — Harmonic mapping

Cross-vertical data must undergo harmonic mapping to determine:
- lawful relationship strength
- directionality (one-way or bidirectional)
- environmental impact class
- regeneration uplift or degradation impact
- compliance requirements

Mapping ensures mathematical coherence between truth-domains.

Article 5 — Prohibited equivalence

The system rejects:
- statistical correlation without physical evidence
- AI-generated equivalence proposals
- domain contamination (e.g., ESG data written into BIO ledger)
- synthetic environmental modeling
- economic-value-based equivalence
- conversion without jurisdictional coherence

Cross-domain claims must pass PD-chain, harmonic, and constitutional validation.

Article 6 — Sovereign compliance and environmental law

The model supports:
- regulatory alignment
- scientific verification
- indigenous land law and water rights
- traceability for carbon, nitrogen, water, biomass, and waste
- jurisdiction-specific compliance mapping

Only lawful jurisdiction-chain outcomes may influence equivalence.

Article 7 — Evidence chain requirements

Equivalence must be supported by:
- physical origin proof
- environmental or mechanical measurements
- device lineage
- timestamp pairing
- harmonic classification
- ledger-domain references

Evidence must be reconstructable.

Article 8 — Applications

The multi-vertical equivalence model enables:
- integrated ESG reporting grounded in truth
- renewable energy markets with real-world validation
- soil and agricultural regeneration metrics
- water-quality integrity systems
- plastic circularity verification
- cross-sector environmental economy design
- sovereign environmental markets backed by physical evidence

Truth between domains becomes measurable and lawful.
