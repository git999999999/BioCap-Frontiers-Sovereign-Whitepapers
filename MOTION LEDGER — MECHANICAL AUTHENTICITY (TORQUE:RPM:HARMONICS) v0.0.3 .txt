Preamble

The Motion Ledger records mechanical truth: torque, rotation, harmonic vibration, and lawful physical motion as measured by verified sovereign devices. It establishes a one-to-one representation of mechanical reality, ensuring that every recorded event originates from genuine physical activity. The Motion Ledger prevents simulated motion, falsified telemetry, or AI-generated mechanical signatures from influencing the system. It is the foundation for sovereign mechanical authenticity across terrestrial, industrial, transport, and off-world environments.

Article 1 — Introduction

Conventional telemetry systems allow fabricated signals, replayed data, software-generated motion, and simulated vibration profiles. These systems cannot distinguish between true mechanical activity and synthetic input. The Motion Ledger eliminates these weaknesses by requiring PD-chain verification, harmonic classification, and lineage integrity for every mechanical event.

Article 2 — Physical motion requirements

To be accepted into the Motion Ledger, a mechanical reading must:
- originate from lawful hardware with sealed lineage
- include torque, RPM, vibration, or rotational metrics
- demonstrate harmonic signatures consistent with real-world mechanics
- contain timestamp pairing (UTC and local)
- include jurisdiction metadata
- satisfy PD-chain equivalence

Any data lacking a measurable physical origin is rejected.

Article 3 — Torque authenticity

Torque readings must:
- be measurable by calibrated hardware
- correspond to physical load, rotation, or resistance
- align with harmonic vibration patterns
- show non-synthetic temporal progression
- contain verifiable lineage and device signatures

Synthetic torque patterns fail harmonic validation.

Article 4 — Rotational and RPM truth

Rotation-based measurements must:
- follow harmonic cadence and periodicity
- match the expected mechanical rhythm
- remain free of repetition artifacts or simulation patterns
- maintain correct timestamp spacing and load correlation

Replay attacks, simulated RPM curves, or AI-generated rotational sequences cannot enter the ledger.

Article 5 — Harmonic vibration signatures

All mechanical motion expresses harmonic fingerprints that cannot be perfectly reproduced synthetically. The Motion Ledger validates:
- amplitude progression
- harmonic resonance
- vibration symmetry and decay
- cross-axis coherence
- environmental coupling

Synthetic vibration patterns fail due to missing harmonic subtleties.

Article 6 — Lineage and PD-chain verification

Every Motion Ledger entry must include:
- parent reference chain
- SHA-512 payload hash
- Ed25519 device lineage signature
- harmonic identity classification
- jurisdiction and timestamp pairing
- PD-chain compliance proof

Lineage breaks immediately trigger arbitration.

Article 7 — Attack prevention

The Motion Ledger prevents:
- software-generated motion simulation
- cloned or spoofed device identities
- replayed mechanical sequences
- tampered rotational logs
- timestamp manipulation
- AI-generated torque or vibration models
- synthetic load patterns

Mechanical truth cannot be forged.

Article 8 — Applications

The Motion Ledger enables:
- industrial machine integrity
- transport and fleet sovereignty
- manufacturing quality assurance
- disaster mode mechanical proof
- orbital rotational telemetry (BioCapSE)
- regenerative agriculture machinery validation
- insurance verification of mechanical events

Mechanical truth becomes a sovereign asset.
