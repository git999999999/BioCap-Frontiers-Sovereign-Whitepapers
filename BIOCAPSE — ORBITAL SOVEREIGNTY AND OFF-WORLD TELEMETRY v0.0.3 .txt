Preamble

BioCapSE extends the sovereignty of the Agile Exchange beyond Earth, enabling lawful identity, PD-chain evidence, harmonic truth, and packet lineage to operate in orbital and deep-space environments. Off-world telemetry must remain physically valid, lineage-complete, and resistant to synthetic contamination even under extreme radiation, vacuum conditions, signal latency, and periods of communication blackout. BioCapSE ensures that orbital truth remains sovereign truth.

Article 1 — Introduction

Spacecraft, satellites, and orbital missions depend on telemetry systems vulnerable to simulation, spoofing, compression artifacts, synthetic noise, replayed sequences, and artificial reconstruction. Traditional systems cannot guarantee physical-digital equivalence in orbit. BioCapSE resolves this by embedding sovereign identity, PD-chain enforcement, and harmonic verification directly into off-world devices.

Article 2 — Sovereign hardware requirements

BioCapSE must contain:
- sealed non-exportable cryptographic keys
- radiation-hardened lineage memory
- on-device SHA-512 hashing engine
- harmonic signature generator for off-world cadence
- sensors for rotational, thermal, radiation, and vibrational truth
- dual timestamp systems (local mission clock and Earth reference)
- jurisdiction metadata (Earth-origin and mission-specific)
- PD-chain conversion hardware

This ensures that orbital data remains lawful and tamper-proof.

Article 3 — Off-world telemetry domains

BioCapSE records:
- rotational velocity and torque signatures
- thermal gradients and radiation exposure
- vibration and resonance from propulsion events
- orientation changes and attitude control corrections
- microgravity mechanical behavior
- orbital path integrity
- docking, landing, and maneuver events
- environmental interactions with solar wind or debris

Every measurement must reflect true off-world physics.

Article 4 — PD-chain equivalence and vacuum operation

PD-chain must function even without Earth communication. BioCapSE:
- seals data locally with lineage
- continues cadence cycles during blackout
- uses mission-clock timestamps when Earth-time is unavailable
- reconciles PD-chain evidence once reconnected
- prevents synthetic substitution during downtime

Orbital truth cannot be replaced by simulation.

Article 5 — Harmonic law in microgravity

Off-world harmonic signatures differ from terrestrial patterns but remain lawful. BioCapSE ensures:
- harmonic identity remains bound to the biological operator or mission controller
- mechanical harmonics reflect microgravity physics
- cadence adapts to orbital motion without losing structure
- off-cadence events trigger anomaly detection

The harmonic law is universal, not Earth-limited.

Article 6 — Arbitration under isolation

When anomalies occur:
- ARB-NOTICE packets are issued on-device
- suspicious events are isolated
- arbitration is deferred until reconnection
- no rewriting or substitution is allowed
- orbital lineage remains sealed

Arbitration outcomes apply once contact is restored.

Article 7 — Attack prevention

BioCapSE prevents:
- ground-based injection attacks
- synthetic telemetry streams
- replayed orbital data
- AI-generated motion patterns
- spoofed positioning attempts
- post-event rewriting during blackout
- tampered mission logs

Off-world truth is defended by lineage, hashing, cadence, and hardware identity.

Article 8 — Applications

BioCapSE enables:
- sovereign satellite governance
- orbital truth markets (ESG, radiation, solar exposure)
- off-world mechanical authenticity
- space station legality and compliance
- trajectory and maneuver verification
- lunar and Martian mission integrity
- secure scientific measurement
- sovereign off-world identity systems

BioCapSE transforms orbital data into sovereign truth.
