Preamble

The shipping and logistics truth system ensures that every container, pallet, parcel, and shipment maintains a complete, immutable lineage from origin to destination. Traditional supply chains rely on barcodes, paperwork, unverifiable logs, and trust-based reporting, all of which are vulnerable to fraud, substitution, contamination, loss, and synthetic reconstruction. The sovereign logistics framework eliminates these vulnerabilities by binding all movement and handling events to PD-chain evidence, harmonic classification, and jurisdictional correctness.

Article 1 — Introduction

Global logistics suffer from:
- container substitution and identity fraud
- falsified chain-of-custody records
- corrupted or missing manifests
- synthetic GPS movement paths
- tampered seals and forged inspection logs
- AI-generated delivery records
- unverifiable environmental impact data
- illegal waste or contraband insertion

Deterministic container lineage corrects these weaknesses using physical truth and immutable evidence.

Article 2 — Container truth identity

Each container or shipment receives:
- a lineage-bound identity signature
- non-exportable hardware key association
- jurisdiction metadata
- harmonic classification (.3, .6, .9)
- physical seal verification (mechanical truth)
- payload metadata tied to measurable events

Identity cannot be cloned or synthetically created.

Article 3 — PD-chain for shipping events

Every logistics event must pass PD-chain conversion:
- SHA-512 hashing of measurement data
- sealed lineage signature
- timestamp pairing (UTC and local)
- jurisdiction and corridor metadata
- parent–child chain references
- constitutional routing checks

If PD-chain equivalence fails, the event is invalid.

Article 4 — Deterministic shipping lineage

Lineage records include:
- handoff events between carriers
- port and terminal transitions
- route and corridor verification
- container integrity checks
- environmental exposure signatures
- temperature, vibration, and handling data
- customs and jurisdiction crossings

Every handling event must correspond to physical truth.

Article 5 — Anti-fraud and anti-substitution protections

The system prevents:
- container swaps or tampering
- synthetic journey reconstruction
- forged inspection or customs stamps
- fabricated delivery confirmations
- tampered seals or faked seal IDs
- misreported environmental compliance
- AI-generated chain-of-custody data

Only physical events validated through PD-chain can modify lineage.

Article 6 — Environmental and ESG integration

Container lineage integrates with:
- ESG ledger for environmental impact truth
- PLASTIC ledger for waste movement and recovery
- WATER and MARINE ledgers for maritime interactions
- REC for renewable-energy-powered logistics events
- BIO for agricultural and biological cargo verification

Cross-domain relationships follow harmonic mapping rules.

Article 7 — Arbitration for shipping discrepancies

Arbitration resolves:
- custody disputes
- route anomalies
- timestamp or jurisdiction conflicts
- seal integrity failures
- container substitution attempts

Arbitration outcomes are deterministic and cannot be influenced by narrative or negotiation.

Article 8 — Applications

Deterministic container lineage enables:
- global supply-chain transparency
- anti-counterfeit and anti-smuggling enforcement
- ESG-compliant logistics markets
- insurance-grade shipping verification
- disaster-mode transport reconstruction
- cross-border customs and tariff truth
- sovereign fleet and cargo governance
- off-world cargo and mission logistics (BioCapSE)

Every shipment becomes a provable truth-state.
