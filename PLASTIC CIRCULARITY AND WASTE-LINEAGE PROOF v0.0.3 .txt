Preamble

The PLASTIC ledger establishes sovereign truth in plastic lifecycle management, waste movement, recycling authenticity, and circular economy verification. Traditional waste systems allow misreporting, illegal dumping, fraudulent recycling claims, and unverifiable chain-of-custody. The sovereign PLASTIC ledger ensures that every piece of material has an immutable lineage from creation to reuse or disposal. Synthetic recycling claims, falsified recovery data, and unverified waste flows become impossible under PD-chain and harmonic law.

Article 1 — Introduction

Global plastic management suffers from structural opacity. Recycling systems report volumes that cannot be verified, waste is routinely misclassified, and circular economy metrics depend on self-reporting rather than physical truth. Plastic waste often travels across borders without traceability, enabling fraud and environmental harm. The PLASTIC ledger fixes this by establishing material-level truth through sovereign devices and immutable lineage.

Article 2 — Material truth domains

The PLASTIC ledger records:
- material type and physical attributes
- creation and manufacturing origin
- first-use lifecycle events
- collection, sorting, and transportation
- recycling, repurposing, and processing
- contamination and degradation signatures
- disposal pathways and final state

Every entry must represent measurable physical reality.

Article 3 — PD-chain physical-digital equivalence

All material events must pass PD-chain verification:
- sealed lineage signatures
- SHA-512 hashing at every lifecycle stage
- timestamp pairing (UTC and local)
- jurisdiction and custody metadata
- harmonic classification of event type
- parent–child chain linking for all transfers

No event may enter the ledger without physical evidence.

Article 4 — Waste-lineage chain of custody

Lineage tracks:
- who handled the material
- where it moved
- how it changed form
- whether contamination occurred
- if processing was lawful
- whether circularity targets were met

Breaks in lineage trigger immediate arbitration.

Article 5 — Circularity proof

To claim circularity, a material must:
- be physically collected
- undergo verified sorting
- pass contamination thresholds
- enter lawful repurposing or recycling
- emerge as a measurable output product

Modelled or estimated circularity cannot be recorded.

Article 6 — Fraud and dumping prevention

The PLASTIC ledger prevents:
- fake recycling volumes
- mislabelled waste streams
- illegal offshore dumping
- substitution of contaminated or non-recyclable materials
- AI-generated or simulated lifecycle data
- cross-jurisdiction manipulation of waste status

Circularity must reflect truth, not paperwork.

Article 7 — Integration with environmental domains

PLASTIC integrates with:
- ESG for environmental compliance
- WATER for hydrological contamination analysis
- BIO for soil and biological waste impact
- REC for energy use in processing
- TRANSPORT sovereign systems for movement logging

Cross-domain correlations require harmonic and constitutional validation.

Article 8 — Applications

The PLASTIC ledger enables:
- traceable global recycling markets
- sovereign circular economy verification
- real-time waste auditing and compliance
- enforcement against illegal dumping
- accurate ESG and sustainability reporting
- verifiable municipal waste systems
- industrial and supply-chain waste accountability
- off-world material lifecycle tracking (BioCapSE)

Material truth becomes sovereign truth.
