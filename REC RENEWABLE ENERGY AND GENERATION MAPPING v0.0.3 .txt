Preamble

The REC ledger records renewable energy generation, movement, consumption, and jurisdictional validation using PD-chain and harmonic law. Unlike traditional renewable certificate systems that rely on self-reported numbers, unverifiable production estimates, or synthetic market instruments, the sovereign REC ledger accepts only physically measured energy truth. Every watt recorded in the system must originate from lawful physical generation.

Article 1 — Introduction

Renewable energy markets suffer from fraud, double counting, unverifiable offsets, and synthetic REC creation. These failures occur because legacy systems have no physical-digital equivalence and no device lineage. The REC ledger eliminates these vulnerabilities by ensuring that all renewable energy records originate from sealed devices and measurable physical production.

Article 2 — Generation truth requirements

To be recorded in the REC ledger, energy generation must be:
- measured by a sovereign device with lineage-bound hardware
- supported by voltage, wattage, and frequency signatures
- timestamp paired (UTC and local)
- accompanied by jurisdiction metadata
- sealed with SHA-512 hashing
- verified through PD-chain equivalence

Synthetic or estimated energy production is rejected.

Article 3 — Harmonic classification

Generation events align with harmonic logic:
- .3 for environmental and biological energy sources
- .6 for structural, grid-level energy architecture
- .9 for active power generation events

This structure allows lawful correlation with ESG, WATER, and BIO verticals.

Article 4 — Grid mapping and routing

The REC ledger maps:
- energy generation sources
- grid routing paths
- interconnection points
- consumption events
- load balancing signatures
- renewable dispatch verification

All paths must remain jurisdictionally lawful and harmonically consistent.

Article 5 — Prevention of synthetic RECs

The system prohibits:
- artificial REC creation
- double counting across jurisdictions
- unverifiable offset markets
- simulation-based energy claims
- third-party “greenwashing” reports

Every REC exists only because a real, measurable physical event occurred.

Article 6 — Arbitration and anomaly detection

Anomalies such as irregular frequency signatures, timestamp gaps, harmonic mismatch, or load inconsistencies trigger:
- ARB-NOTICE packets
- device-level isolation
- PD-chain reevaluation
- ledger quarantine of affected entries

Arbitration restores truth when inconsistencies arise.

Article 7 — Compliance and regulatory use

The REC ledger enables:
- government and regulatory verification
- cross-border renewable tracking
- utility-level compliance
- sovereign energy credit markets
- off-grid renewable validation
- community-level microgrid sovereignty

Jurisdictional boundaries are enforced using metadata and cadence rules.

Article 8 — Applications

The REC ledger supports:
- solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and emerging renewables
- verified low-carbon industrial systems
- ESG-aligned renewable markets
- corporate sustainability accounting
- grid resilience and disaster verification
- off-world energy generation (BioCapSE)

This ledger guarantees that renewable energy is not imagined, but measured.
