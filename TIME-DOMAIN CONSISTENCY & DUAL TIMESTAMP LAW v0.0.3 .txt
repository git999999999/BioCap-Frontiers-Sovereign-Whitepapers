Preamble

Time-domain consistency ensures that every event recorded in the Agile Exchange reflects lawful, verifiable time anchored to physical reality. Timestamp manipulation is one of the most common attack vectors across digital systems, enabling fraud, synthetic state reconstruction, identity spoofing, cross-ledger contamination, and replay attacks. Dual timestamp law eliminates these vulnerabilities by requiring all sovereign events to contain harmonized UTC and local timestamp pairs, each validated through PD-chain, device lineage, and constitutional routing.

Article 1 — Introduction

Conventional systems rely on:
- single timestamps
- device clocks vulnerable to drift
- synthetic time reconstruction
- cloud time synchronization without identity binding
- logs that can be rewritten or fabricated

Without strict time-domain truth, all evidence becomes suspect. The sovereign timestamp model ensures time itself cannot be falsified.

Article 2 — Dual timestamp requirement

Every sovereign packet must contain:
- UTC timestamp (universal reference)
- Local timestamp (jurisdiction reference)
- PD-chain anchor binding both values
- harmonic cadence mapping for temporal identity
- parent–child lineage enforcing chronological correctness

Events without lawful dual timestamps are invalid.

Article 3 — Timestamp drift detection

Devices must:
- monitor drift between UTC and local time
- apply harmonic cadence checks to detect anomalies
- issue ARB-NOTICE for drift beyond constitutional thresholds
- maintain lineage continuity for corrected timestamps

Drift cannot be used to disguise synthetic or replayed activity.

Article 4 — Temporal jurisdiction law

Local timestamps must reflect:
- physical location of the event
- jurisdiction boundaries
- environmental or mechanical domain rules
- off-world or orbital temporal context (BioCapSE)

Jurisdiction laundering via time manipulation is prohibited.

Article 5 — PD-chain temporal sealing

PD-chain ensures:
- timestamps cannot be altered after sealing
- lineage enforces chronological sequence
- dual timestamps are hashed into the parent–child chain
- SYSTEM ledger confirms temporal correctness

Any attempt to rewrite past events is automatically detectable.

Article 6 — Off-world and orbital time law

BioCapSE devices operate in domains where:
- communication blackouts occur
- relativistic effects may impact timing
- local mission clocks diverge from Earth clocks
- environmental conditions influence oscillator stability

Off-world timestamps must be reconciled using:
- mission clock lineage
- harmonic cadence mapping
- orbital jurisdiction metadata
- SYSTEM arbitration for temporal corrections

Time remains lawful even outside Earth's frame.

Article 7 — Attack and fraud prevention

Dual timestamp law prevents:
- replay attacks
- synthetic packet insertion
- retroactive ledger manipulation
- falsified chronology in logistics or insurance
- emissions reporting time fraud
- energy generation misalignment
- fabricated environmental timelines
- AI-generated temporal reconstruction

Time becomes unalterable.

Article 8 — Applications

Time-domain sovereignty supports:
- deterministic arbitration
- financial settlement integrity
- environmental and ESG timeline proof
- sovereign transport and logistics accuracy
- disaster-mode event sequencing
- multi-realm integration (Earth ↔ Orbit)
- scientific and industrial temporal truth

The system becomes temporally incorruptible.
