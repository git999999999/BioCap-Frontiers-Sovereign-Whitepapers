Preamble

Sovereign document governance defines how all constitutional documents, whitepapers, doctrines, and system instructions progress from creation (SDE), to verification (SDV), to sovereign sealing (SDK). This lifecycle ensures that no document enters the Agile Exchange without lawful authorship, harmonic correctness, version integrity, and immutable lineage. The governance model prevents synthetic documents, unauthorized revisions, and interpretive drift.

Article 1 — Introduction

Digital ecosystems often treat documents as mutable assets, allowing version confusion, unauthorized edits, synthetic insertions, and unverified authorship. These risks undermine trust, legal standing, and system coherence. The sovereign model eliminates such vulnerabilities by enforcing a document truth lifecycle tied to evidence, authorship, cadence, and constitutional boundaries.

Article 2 — SDE — Sovereign Document Edition (Creation)

During the SDE phase:
- the document is authored by a lawful creator
- authorship identity is proven via BioCapES
- an initial version number is assigned (0.0.3 under genesis law)
- harmonic structure is embedded
- jurisdiction metadata is added
- the document remains mutable but lineage-bound

SDE documents cannot be executed by the system.

Article 3 — SDV — Sovereign Document Verification (Validation)

Before a document becomes sovereign:
- lineage must be verified
- harmonic correctness must be checked
- PD-chain signatures must be applied
- constitutional alignment must be confirmed
- arbitration must evaluate conflicts or ambiguity
- version number must be locked

SDV documents are read-only pending final sealing.

Article 4 — SDK — Sovereign Document Keying (Sealing)

SDK is the final and immutable stage:
- the document is sealed under sovereign authority
- version number becomes permanent
- constitutional hash is recorded in SYSTEM ledger
- cross-ledger references are established
- jurisdiction and authorship metadata become immutable
- further edits are prohibited unless through new SDE creation

SDK documents become part of the sovereign state.

Article 5 — Version lineage and immutability

Version lineage requires:
- chronological ordering
- strict adherence to the 0.0.3 foundational version
- no deletion or modification of historical versions
- lineage reconstruction via hash trails

All versions must remain discoverable and immutable.

Article 6 — Attack and fraud prevention

Document governance prevents:
- unauthorized edits
- synthetic document insertion
- AI-generated doctrine or whitepaper fabrication
- version spoofing
- reinterpretation attacks
- constitutional drift

Only documents with sovereign lineage may influence system behavior.

Article 7 — Cross-domain integration

SDE, SDV, and SDK apply to all:
- constitutional titles and articles
- doctrines (Truth, Archive, Identity, Garden, Harmonic Gate, etc.)
- whitepapers (3 → 6 → 9 → 9 → 18 sequence)
- system-level instructions
- treasury and governance statements

Document governance ensures that all domains reflect the same lawful truth.

Article 8 — Applications

Sovereign document governance enables:
- auditable constitutional evolution
- cross-ledger legal consistency
- deterministic rule enforcement
- strict system integrity
- lawful AI constraint frameworks
- off-world governance packages (BioCapSE)
- globally verifiable document truth

Documents become sovereign entities with lineage, identity, and purpose.
